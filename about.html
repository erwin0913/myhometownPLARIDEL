                        <p>
                            Plaridel, originally named Quiñginá, is a
                            first-class municipality in the province of Bulacan,
                            Philippines. Located just 35 kilometers north of
                            Manila, this progressive town serves as an important
                            gateway between Metro Manila and northern Luzon.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            With a population of over 100,000 people, Plaridel
                            balances rapid economic development with rich
                            cultural preservation. The town is known for its
                            thriving agriculture, growing industries, and warm,
                            welcoming community.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The town was renamed in honor of Marcelo H. del
                            Pilar, the great Philippine reformist and journalist
                            who was born here on August 30, 1850.

                            Plaridel traces its origins to pre-colonial times
                            when it was called Quiñginá, derived from the
                            Tagalog words "quing" (to block) and "ina" (mother),
                            referring to the town's strategic position
                            controlling river access.

                        <p>
                            In 1850, Marcelo H. del Pilar was born in Barangay
                            San Nicolas. Known as "Bulacan Socrates," he became
                            one of the leading figures of the Propaganda
                            Movement that paved the way for Philippine
                            independence.

                            The municipality was renamed Plaridel in 1939 under
                            Executive Order No. 158 signed by President Manuel
                            L. Quezon, honoring the town's most illustrious son
                            who fought for press freedom and national
